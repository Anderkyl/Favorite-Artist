    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <h6>Followed by my brief opinion</h6>
    <p>Melanie Martinez is an Iconic Singer and Song writer whom I have come to permanantly name one of my favorite music artists of all time. She stands out from many popular pop artists despite some comparing her to Billie Eilish.</P>
    <br>
    <p>Her style of music is classified as <mark> Pop; art pop; indie pop; R&B; electropop; hip hop; dark pop</mark> all the while being most known for unique style choice of music delivery. Every music video is styled with the intentions in an easy three key process. very vintage, very frilly, very dark message, and very <i>pink.</i></p>
