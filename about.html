    <p><sup>[22]</sup> Martinez says she had few friends growing up and was a homebody, as she was "very emotional" and found it difficult to explain her feelings, crying when overwhelmed.<sup>[23]</sup> She practiced photography and painting.<sup>[24]</sup> Due to her emotionality as a child,<sup>[23]</sup> she claims to have been referred to as a "cry baby" by others, which sparked the creation of the titular character of her debut album, Cry Baby.<sup>[25][26][27]</sup></p>
    <br>
    <p>Martinez grew up in a "traditional Latin household" where she was made to feel shameful about talking about sexuality and felt as if she would not be accepted if she came out. She claims that her family is now fully accepting of her being bisexual.<sup>[28]</sup></p>
    <br>
    <p>At fourteen, Martinez taught herself how to play guitar by studying chord diagrams of songs she enjoyed, which she found online, and wrote her first song by adding her poetry to one of the chord diagrams,<sup>[23][29]</sup> but claims that playing guitar "eventually got stale".<sup>[24][26][27][30]</sup> Martinez graduated from Baldwin High School.<sup>[31][32]</sup></p>
